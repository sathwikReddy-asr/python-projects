Crime Safety Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project analyzes crime data from 2020 to 2025 to identify different crime types, the number of victims affected, and trends in crime rates across various states and cities.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries used:

Pandas â€“ Data manipulation and cleaning

Seaborn â€“ Data visualization

Matplotlib â€“ Plotting and charts

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
Through this analysis, we were able to determine:

Different crime types reported between 2020-2025.

Which state and city have the highest and lowest crime rates.

Year-wise crime rate comparisons (highest vs. lowest).

Victim demographics: how many victims were affected by each crime type and which gender was most affected by specific crimes.

ðŸš€ How to Run
This project was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. Simply open the notebook file (python_capstone_project.ipynb) in Jupyter and run all the cells sequentially.
